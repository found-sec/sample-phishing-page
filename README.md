# Form submit

When the form is submitted by the user, hackers could redirect to an authentic page like google.com to avoid suspicion of stolen credentials.
Then they would indirectly update their file like phishing.txt in our scenario with the login details and it would be updated on their devices.

## Protect Your Credentials Online

It's easy for hackers to steal your credentials. Follow these tips to stay secure:

1. **Use Strong, Unique Passwords**: Avoid common passwords. Consider using a password manager.
2. **Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: Adds extra protection for your accounts.
3. **Be Wary of Phishing**: Don't click suspicious links or share personal info.
4. **Use Secure Websites**: Look for HTTPS and a padlock icon.
5. **Update Passwords Regularly**: Change them periodically, especially after a breach.
6. **Monitor Accounts**: Check for unusual activity and set up alerts.
7. **Avoid Public Wi-Fi**: Use a VPN when accessing sensitive information.
8. **Keep Software Updated**: Ensure your apps and OS are current.

Stay vigilant and protect your online identity!
